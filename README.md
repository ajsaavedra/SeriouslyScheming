# SeriouslyScheming
This is the first lab in the Programming Languages course that deals with functional programming in Scheme.

Using Scheme, the purpose of this lab is to create two functions:

One called _repeated_ that takes two arguments: a function _f_ of one argument and a non-negative integer _count_. The result of which
is one function of one argument, to which it applies the function _f_ _count_ times.

The second, called _filter_, is an implementation of the built-in function from scratch.

This code is ready to run using the DrRacket IDE.
